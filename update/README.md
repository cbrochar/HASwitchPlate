# HASP Auto-Update

Files here are used for the auto-update routine which will periodically check GitHub for new firmware versions.  

`version-insecure.json` utilizes an externally-hosted proxy to strip off SSL in order to support versions of HASP prior to the introduction of SSL support in v0.41.
